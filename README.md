# Austin 311 analysis using Tableau.
------
### Project Description.

  The goal of this project use the 311 call data from the City of Austin from 2014 to 2016 to determine what the major concerns of Austinites are over three years and within each year, what zip codes have the most 311 calls.
  
 ### Data retrieval and cleaning.

  In the initial .csv file for the analysis the data span from December 2013 to August 2017. Since 2013 and 2017 were incomplete, we decided to focus only on the years 2014 through 2016. 
 
### New Visualization.
